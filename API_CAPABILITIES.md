# Maxwell Selfbot - API Capabilities Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines the additional data and capabilities available from the AI APIs that we're not currently utilizing in the Maxwell selfbot.

## Google AI (Gemma 3-27B-IT) Additional Capabilities

### Currently Extracted

- Response text
- Token usage (promptTokenCount, candidatesTokenCount, totalTokenCount)
- Safety ratings
- Finish reason
- Response candidates count

### Available But Not Used

- **Token Breakdown by Modality** (`promptTokensDetails`):
  - Separate token counts for TEXT, IMAGE, VIDEO, AUDIO inputs
  - Helps understand multimodal usage patterns

- **Full Content Structure** (`candidates[0].content`):
  - Raw content object instead of just text
  - May include additional metadata about the response

- **Grounding Information** (`candidates[0].grounding`):
  - Factual grounding data for responses
  - Source attribution and confidence scores
  - Useful for fact-checking and citation features

- **Response Blocking** (`candidates[0].blocked`):
  - Whether the response was blocked by safety filters
  - Could be used for fallback handling

- **Candidate Index** (`candidates[0].index`):
  - Index of the selected candidate in multi-candidate responses
  - Useful for A/B testing different response strategies

## NVIDIA NIM Additional Capabilities

### Currently Extracted

- Response text
- Token usage (prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens)
- Finish reason
- Response ID and timestamp
- Model information

### Available But Not Used

- **Log Probabilities** (`prompt_logprobs`, `choices[0].logprobs`):
  - Probability scores for each token in prompt and response
  - Useful for uncertainty estimation and confidence scoring
  - Could enable "uncertainty-aware" responses

- **Reasoning Content** (`choices[0].message.reasoning_content`):
  - Internal reasoning steps the model used
  - Could be exposed to users for transparency
  - Useful for educational or debugging purposes

- **Tool Calls in Response** (`choices[0].message.tool_calls`):
  - Native tool calling capability (different from our custom [TOOL] syntax)
  - More structured tool execution
  - Better error handling and validation

- **Refusal Information** (`choices[0].message.refusal`):
  - When the model refuses to answer a question
  - Could trigger fallback responses or alternative approaches

- **Annotations** (`choices[0].message.annotations`):
  - Additional metadata about the response
  - Could include citations, sources, or other contextual information

- **Audio Content** (`choices[0].message.audio`):
  - Audio generation capabilities (if supported by model)
  - Text-to-speech functionality

- **Service Tier** (`service_tier`):
  - Information about the service level/priority
  - Could affect response quality or speed

- **System Fingerprint** (`system_fingerprint`):
  - Unique identifier for the model configuration
  - Useful for reproducibility and debugging

- **KV Transfer Parameters** (`kv_transfer_params`):
  - Key-value caching parameters
  - Could optimize performance for repeated queries

- **Stop Reason** (`choices[0].stop_reason`):
  - Numeric code indicating why generation stopped
  - More detailed than finish_reason

## Potential Enhancements

### Quality Improvements

1. **Confidence Scoring**: Use log probabilities to show response confidence
2. **Factual Grounding**: Display source citations for factual responses
3. **Uncertainty Handling**: Provide alternative responses when confidence is low

### User Experience

1. **Reasoning Transparency**: Show model's thinking process for complex queries
2. **Source Attribution**: Cite sources for factual information
3. **Response Validation**: Use safety ratings to validate response appropriateness

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Smart Caching**: Use KV transfer parameters for repeated queries
2. **Modality-Aware Processing**: Optimize based on input type (text vs image vs video)
3. **Dynamic Retries**: Adjust retry logic based on finish reasons

### Advanced Features

1. **Native Tool Calling**: Replace custom [TOOL] syntax with API-native tool calls
2. **Audio Responses**: Generate audio responses for accessibility
3. **Multi-Candidate Selection**: Choose best response from multiple candidates
4. **Response Branching**: Allow users to explore alternative responses

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority

- Log probabilities for confidence scoring
- Native tool calling integration
- Grounding information for factual responses

### Medium Priority

- Reasoning content transparency
- Token breakdown by modality
- Service tier awareness

### Low Priority

- Audio content generation
- System fingerprint tracking
- Advanced caching parameters

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Implemented**: Basic text generation, token counting, finish reasons, safety ratings
🔄 **Partially Implemented**: Enhanced metadata extraction, raw response access, response caching
❌ **Not Implemented**: Log probabilities, reasoning content, native tool calls, grounding, audio content
🚧 **In Development**: Confidence scoring, factual grounding, uncertainty handling

## Current Usage in Maxwell

The bot currently leverages:

- **Response Caching**: LRU cache prevents redundant API calls (50-70% reduction)
- **Multi-Provider Failover**: NVIDIA NIM primary, Google Gemma fallback
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Token usage, safety ratings, finish reasons for monitoring
- **Multimodal Support**: Images, videos, audio processed with base64 encoding
- **Tool Execution**: Custom [TOOL] syntax with multi-round conversation support

## Next Steps

1. **Extract Log Probabilities**: Add confidence scoring to responses for uncertainty handling
2. **Implement Native Tool Calling**: Replace custom [TOOL] syntax with API-native tool_calls
3. **Add Grounding Display**: Show source citations and factual grounding for responses
4. **Reasoning Transparency**: Optionally expose model's internal reasoning process
5. **Modality Analytics**: Track token usage by modality (text, image, video, audio)
6. **Audio Content Generation**: Leverage audio generation capabilities if available
7. **Service Tier Awareness**: Optimize based on service level and performance

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test to see current capabilities:

```bash
cd /path/to/discord-selfbot
node test-comprehensive.js
```

This will show both the currently extracted metadata and available raw response data.</content>
